# Tree-Based Regression Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with tree-based regression methods by fitting three models—`Gradient-Boosted Regression Tree`, `Random Forest`, and `Decision Tree`—to a noisy 2D linear dataset. The goal is to manually adjust and understand hyperparameters before comparing these values to those found through grid searches.

## Key Objectives

1. **Manual Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Manually sweep the hyperparameter space to observe and understand the influence of different values on the model predictions.
   - Develop an intuition for how changes in hyperparameters affect the prediction curve of each model.

2. **Grid Search Optimization**:
   - Perform grid searches to identify the optimal hyperparameters for each model.
   - Compare the manually tuned hyperparameters with those obtained through grid searches.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Visualize the model predictions using the optimal hyperparameters.
   - Compute the generalization error on a test set for all three models.

4. **Critical Analysis**:
   - Analyze and describe the workings of each algorithm.
   - Compare and contrast the prediction results from the three models.
   - Identify the model that best generalizes the data based on the observed trends and critical analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical experience with tree-based regression models.
- Develop an intuitive understanding of hyperparameter tuning.
- Learn to perform and interpret grid search results.
- Enhance critical thinking about model performance and generalization.
